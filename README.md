The only issue I wasn't able to fully resolve is that the chat system assumes the first created user is the one sending the messages — kind of like the "logged-in" user. At first, I managed to make it so that the first user had id = 1, but for some reason that stopped working later on. So now, you need to manually create that user via the Rails console using: rails console
User.create(id: 1, name: "Your Name"). Once that’s done, everything should work properly again.
I also added the option to delete all users and all chats. For some reason, deleting all users throws an error the first time — but if you try again, it works fine.
